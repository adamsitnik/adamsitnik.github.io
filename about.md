My name is Adam Sitnik. I am a Software Engineer focused on .NET performance and reliability. 

I believe strongly in open source. I contribute to few open source projects: [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet), [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefxlab](https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab) and [the awesome .NET Performance list](https://github.com/adamsitnik/awesome-dot-net-performance). [This blog](https://github.com/adamsitnik/adamsitnik.github.io) is also open source.

I have spent much of my professional life working on systems for energy producers and distributors. It included projects such: energy trading, production optimization, balance settlement and critical events detection. So far no blackouts! 

I am also an ex-MMA practitioner, AFOL, rabbit owner and a huge star wars fan.
