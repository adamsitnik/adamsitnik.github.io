My name is Adam Sitnik. I am a Software Engineer focused on .NET performance and reliability. 

I believe strongly in open source. I contribute to few open source projects: [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet), [dotnet/performance](https://github.com/dotnet/performance), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefxlab](https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab) and [the awesome .NET Performance list](https://github.com/adamsitnik/awesome-dot-net-performance). [This blog](https://github.com/adamsitnik/adamsitnik.github.io) is also open source.

I have spent much of my professional life working on systems for energy producers and distributors. It included projects such as energy trading, production optimization, balance settlement and critical events detection. So far no blackouts!

I currently work for the .NET Team at Microsoft where I work on making the .NET Framework the fastest developer platform on the planet.

I am also an ex-MMA practitioner, AFOL, rabbit owner and a huge star wars fan.

I love challenges.
